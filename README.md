# Project description

- analysis of Parkinson dataset featured in the data folder using Random Forests and Support vector machines;

- projection of the data set on 2d

# Running

- to run the whole code project run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

- in order to run only the random forest classifier run:
```
python main.py 1
```

- similarly, to run the svm model run:
```
python main.py 2
```

# Notes

- unfortunately the train and test data set contain duplicates; this indicates that the test error computed by both models is not an unbiased estimate of the expected error
