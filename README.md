# Project description

- analysis of Parkinson dataset featured in the data folder using Random Forests and Support vector machines;

- projection of the data set on 2d

# Notes

- unfortunately the train and test data set contain duplicates; this indicates that the error provided by both models is not an unbiased estimate of the expected loss
